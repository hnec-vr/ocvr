</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>22.</strong>
    <strong>Q: How many electoral constituencies are there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A:</strong>
    For election purposes, Libya has been divided to three electoral areas and further divided into 11 main constituencies. These main constituencies are
    further divided into 47 voting districts. To see the voting districts go to <a href="http://www.hnec.ly">www.hnec.ly</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Candidates for general seats compete in 46 voting districts. Candidates for the seats reserved for women will compete in 6 voting districts. Candidates for
    the seats reserved for the cultural and linguistic components compete in 6 voting districts.
</p>
<p>
    The candidates for all seats will compete under the majoritarian system. Out of the total of 47 voting districts within the country:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>a) </strong>
    23 voting districts will have only one ballot paper:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        13 voting districts will have a general ballot paper
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    · 1 voting district will have a special ballot paper (cultural component)
</p>
<p>
    · 9 voting districts will have a combination ballot paper on which both candidates for the general seats and candidates for cultural and linguistic
    component seats appear.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>b) </strong>
    24 voting districts will have two ballot papers:
</p>
<p>
    · 23 voting districts will have one general ballot paper and one special ballot paper (women seats)
</p>
<p>
    · 1 voting district will have one special ballot paper (women seats) and one combination ballot paper.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>23. Q: How does the majoritarian system work?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A: </strong>
    Some voting districts will elect one representative and some will elect more than one representative. The number of seats in the voting districts ranges
    from 1 to 3. Individual candidates contest seats at the voting district level. The voters cast one vote for only one candidate and the seats are won by the
    candidates with the most votes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>24. Q: How does a person vote on the combination ballot paper?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A: </strong>
    The combination ballot paper has two sections – one for the general seat candidates and one for the cultural and linguistic component candidates. The voter
    has one vote to cast and can only vote on one section of the ballot paper. The winner of the general race is the candidate who wins the highest number of
    votes among the candidates on the general race section of the ballot paper and the winner of the cultural and linguistic component race is the candidate
    who wins the highest number of votes among the candidates on the cultural and linguistic component race section of the ballot paper.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        25. Q: There are 47 voting districts with different types of seats allocated for each of them. For which voting district will the eligible voters cast
        their votes in OCV?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A: </strong>
    Eligible voters for the OCV process can cast a vote for a voting district of her or his choice. At polling the voters will select the voting district in
    which they wish to cast their votes and depending on the voting district of their choice, will cast either:
</p>
<p>
    · one ballot paper (for general seat, or for cultural component seat, or combination ballot paper) or; <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    · two ballot papers (if the voting district of their choice has two races).<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>26. Q: Do the voters in OCV vote on the same ballot papers as in Libya?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A:</strong>
    No. HNEC will design special ballot papers for the OCV process:
</p>
<p>
    · one ballot paper for the general seats,
</p>
<p>
    · one ballot paper for the seats reserved for women, and
</p>
<p>
    · one combination ballot paper where general seat and cultural and linguistic component seats sections appear.
</p>
<p>
    These ballot papers will not contain the names of candidates; rather, they will contain a table with numbers. The voter will need to mark the number in the
    table corresponding to the number of the candidate as it appears on the in-country ballot paper.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>27. Q: How will the OCV voters know who the candidates are?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>A: </strong>
Once confirmed, the HNEC will publish a list of all the candidates registered to contest in each voting district on their website    <a href="http://www.hnec.ly">http://www.hnec.ly</a>. Additionally, in each PS, there will be a PS staff member who will:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. </strong>
    Help voters identify the voting district for which they wish to cast their vote,
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. </strong>
    Provide a booklet listing all the eligible candidates for that voting district, in the order in which they appear on the in-country ballot paper, and
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. </strong>
    Explain how to mark the ballot paper.
</p>
<p>
