Candidates for general seats compete in 46 voting districts. Candidates for the seats reserved for women will compete in 6 voting districts. Candidates for the seats reserved for the cultural and linguistic components compete in 6 voting districts.
The candidates for all seats will compete under the majoritarian system.  Out of the total of 47 voting districts within the country:

•	13 voting districts will have a general ballot paper
•	1 voting district will have a special ballot paper (cultural component)
•	9 voting districts will have a combination ballot paper on which both candidates for the general seats and candidates for cultural and linguistic component seats appear.
b)	24 voting districts will have two ballot papers: 
•	23 voting districts will have one general ballot paper and one special ballot paper (women seats) 
•	1 voting district will have one special ballot paper (women seats) and one combination ballot paper.

23. 	Q: How does the majoritarian system work?
A:  Some voting districts will elect one representative and some will elect more than one representative. The number of seats in the voting districts ranges from 1 to 3.

24.	Q: How does a person vote on the combination ballot paper?
A: The combination ballot paper has two sections – one for the general seat candidates and one for the cultural and linguistic component candidates. The voter has one vote to cast and can only vote on one section of the ballot paper. The winner of the general race is the candidate who wins the highest number of votes among the candidates on the general race section of the ballot paper and the winner of the cultural and linguistic component race is the candidate who wins the highest number of votes among the candidates on the cultural and linguistic component race section of the ballot paper.

•	two ballot papers (if the voting district of their choice has two races).

26.	Q: Do the voters in OCV vote on the same ballot papers as in Libya?
A: No.  HNEC will design special ballot papers for the OCV process:
•	one ballot paper for the general seats, 
•	one ballot paper for the seats reserved for women, and
•	one combination ballot paper where general seat and cultural and linguistic component seats sections appear. 
These ballot papers will not contain the names of candidates; rather, they will contain a table with numbers. The voter will need to mark the number in the table corresponding to the number of the candidate as it appears on the in-country ballot paper. 

27.	Q: How will the OCV voters know who the candidates are?
A: Once confirmed, the HNEC will publish a list of all the candidates registered to contest in each voting district on their website http://www.hnec.ly. Additionally, in each PS, there will be a PS staff member who will: 
1.	Help voters identify the voting district for which they wish to cast their vote, 
2.	Provide a booklet listing all the eligible candidates for that voting district, in the order in which they appear on the in-country ballot paper, and 
3.	Explain how to mark the ballot paper."
